# **🎬 Case Study: The Netflix Data Engine**

## **The Scenario**

Netflix doesn't just show you movies; it predicts what you want before you know it. This recommendation system is a perfect example of the **Data Lifecycle**.

## **👥 Group Discussion Questions**

Break into small groups and answer the following. Use your knowledge of Structured vs. Unstructured data.

### **Part 1: Collection (What data do they have?)**

*List at least 3 examples for each category that Netflix likely collects about you:*

* **Explicit Data (Things you click):** (e.g., Thumbs up/down...)  
* **Implicit Data (Things you do):** (e.g., Did you pause at a scary scene? Did you binge-watch 5 episodes?)

### **Part 2: Structured vs. Unstructured**

* **Structured Data:** User ID, Movie Genre, Release Year.  
* **Unstructured Data:** The movie thumbnails (images), the movie plot summary (text), the video files themselves.  
  * *Question: How might Netflix use the **Unstructured** data (thumbnails) to trick you into watching a movie?*

### **Part 3: The Algorithm (Analysis)**

* If User A watches "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul".  
* And User B watches "Breaking Bad".  
* *What will the algorithm recommend to User B? Why?*

### **Part 4: Ethics (The "Bubble")**

* *Is it ethical for an algorithm to only show you things it knows you will like? Does this create a 'content bubble' that limits your exposure to new ideas?*
