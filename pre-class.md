# **📚 Pre-Study: The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs**

* **The Analogy:** Think of building an AI like building a house. You cannot put on the roof (AI) until you have a foundation (Data Collection) and walls (Data Cleaning).  
* **Reference Article:** Read "The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs" by Monica Rogati (Search for this title on Google/Medium).

**The AI vs. DS vs. Analytics Table**

| Feature | Data Analytics | Data Science | Artificial Intelligence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Goal** | Explain what happened in the past. | Predict what will happen next. | Automate decisions like a human. |
| **Question** | "Why did sales drop in June?" | "How many sales will we have in July?" | "Automatically re-order stock when low." |
| **Analogy** | The Rear-view Mirror | The Weather Forecast | The Self-Driving Car |

**Exercise** 

* Before Class 2 begins, please read the provided article ["The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs"](https://medium.com/@hugh_data_science/the-pyramid-of-data-needs-and-why-it-matters-for-your-career-b0f695c13f11) . Then, use NotebookLM to deepen your understanding.

## **🤖 NotebookLM Prompt Guide**

Upload the article to NotebookLM and try these prompts:

### **1\. The Core Definitions**

"Based on this text, what is the clear difference between **Data Analytics**, **Data Science**, and **AI**? Create a comparison table showing the 'Goal', 'Typical Tools', and 'Output' for each."

### **2\. The Pyramid Analogy**

"Why is this model called a 'Hierarchy of Needs'? Explain the analogy to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Why can't we do AI/Deep Learning without first doing 'Data Collection'?"

### **3\. Self-Assessment**

"Quiz me on the different levels of the pyramid. Ask me 3 questions, one by one, and correct me if I'm wrong."

## **📝 Preparation for Class**

Be ready to discuss:

* *Why do most companies fail when they try to jump straight to AI?*  
* *Where do you think our '1 Million Row' project fits in this hierarchy?*
